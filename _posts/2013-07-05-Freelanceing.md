So after a lot of hard work, I've started my own cnc carving company, Minerva Carving. We are going to make house signs and furniture, But also do some rapid prototyping on the side.

##Buying a Cnc Machine
After a lot of discussion with uk based manufacterers we decided to buy and 8x4 foot cnc machine, which will arive by the end of the month. In the mean time we have rented a small A3 machine to make samples of signs and get used to the whole design process. Which I am finding ralativly easy.

##Designing in Ai
The good thing about it is that with my background in graphic design, I already know how to design vectors, and I can use Adobe Illustrator as well as Sketch to design shapes or type or even a mellenium falcon and then just export that to Vectric, the program we used as a middle man between design and gcode.

It also allows me to have finer controll over my designs compaired to Vectric which is a prowefull tool but it difficult to use sometimes due to it sepperation simple processes across a few buttons rather than in illustrator as an exaple font selection, size and kerning are in one place.

##The main problem 
Is the fact that Vectirc is a wondows program and I'm a mac user, so my current setup is either design on mac and use a virtualbox shared folder to transfer Items to windows, or design in vectirc.

I think, i will eventually get a windows computer purely to run vectric, but in the mean time I will just use a vertual box.

##Freelancing

I am also freelancing 2-3 days a week for a local company called Externiture, who make bus stops. They wanted a graphic designinger who could design a whole range of print based material to held them gain new clients. So far I am deisgning a product catouloge and it is going pretty well. Once it is finished I will post some photo's.
