I've been intrested in Skateboarding apparell and board designs for a long time and thought it was about time I tried my hand at designing a series of board designs.

##Concept Idea
The concept was to create a set of skateboard designs, I wanted to use full size colour images of famous women. I first of all designed a poster in Illustrator.

##Finishing off 
I really like the finished newspaper, I got it printed at [The Newspaper Club](http://www.newspaperclub.com/) which was a really quick and straight forward process. You can see a full pdf of the project [here](/images/pdf/skate-posterdps.pdf)
