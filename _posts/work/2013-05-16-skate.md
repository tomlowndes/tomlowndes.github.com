I've been intrested in Skateboarding apparell and board designs for a long time and thought it was about time I tried my hand at designing a series of board designs.

##Concept Idea
The concept was to create a set of skateboard designs, I wanted to use full size colour images of famous women. I first of all designed a poster in Illustrator.

One I had the main poster vector design for the poster I opened it in photoshop to add the finisging touches to the designs.

##Finishing off
I wanted to finish off the posters by adding texture to the backround of the design as well as framing them.
