Valour was a magazine that I created for my end of year project, whilst I was studying at Salford University. The Idea was to create a male magazine to do with fashion and lifestyle.

##Concept Idea
The concept was to create a magazine featuring articles about living life as a modern male. After sourcing articles, images, reasurching grids and looking at existing magazines (both print and digital.) I started to create rough grid layouts and put the articales in a working order. 

##Cover Shoot
Fot the front and rear cover of the magazine, I asked my friend Tom Whitley to model for me. With the help of some other friends we used the photography studio at university to take a lot of photo's, that I could later edit and select the most appropreate one for my magazine cover.

##Magazine vs Newspaper

After starting to design a grid to standard magazine dimensions of 215.9 mm x 279.4 mm, I decided that I wanted to have more room to play around with so looked at newspaper dimensions and had two sizes to choose from.
