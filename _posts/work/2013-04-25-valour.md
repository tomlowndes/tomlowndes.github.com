Valour was a magazine that I created for my end of year project, whilst I was studying at Salford University. The Idea was to create a male magazine to do with fashion and lifestyle.

##Concept Idea
The concept was to create a magazine featuring articles about living life as a modern male. After sourcing articles, images, researching grids and looking at existing magazines (both print and digital.) I started to create rough grid layouts and put the articles in a working order. 

##Cover Shoot
For the front and rear cover of the magazine, I asked my friend Tom Whitley to model for me. With the help of some other friends we used the photography studio at university to take a lot of photo's, that I could later edit and select the most appropriate one for my magazine cover.

##Magazine vs. Newspaper
After starting to design a grid to standard magazine dimensions of 215.9 mm x 279.4 mm, I decided that I wanted to have more room to play around with so looked at newspaper dimensions and had two sizes to choose from. Tabloid which is 259 mm x 350 mm or Broadsheet which is 350 mm x 548 mm. So after looking for a printers who do limited runs I decided to go with Tabloid because of the cost for only getting 5 - 10 copies printed.

##Finishing off 
I really like the finished newspaper, I got it printed at [The Newspaper Club](http://www.newspaperclub.com/) which was a really quick and straight forward process. You can see a full pdf of the project [here](/images/pdf/valourdps.pdf)
