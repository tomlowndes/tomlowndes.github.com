hotline-miami is a indie game that was released in late 2012. I was so in love with this game during its development that I could not wait for it to be released.

##What I Did
I really wanted to create a gritty, styleized poster in anticipation of the release of this game, I had a look at some early artwork and gameplay screenshots and came up with this idea

##Concept Idea
The concept was to create a painted, deam like mural of the main charictor.
