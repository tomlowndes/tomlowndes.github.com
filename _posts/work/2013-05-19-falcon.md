I've been looking for a Millenium Falcon schematic poster, but I couldn't find one that I liked. So I decided to design my own. I found a schematic drawing in a Star Wars book that I owned. I scanned it and replicated it using the pen tool.

##Vector Drawing

One I had the main poster vector design for the poster I opened it in photoshop to add the finisging touches to the designs.

##Finishing off
I wanted to finish off the posters by adding texture to the backround of the design as well as framing them.
