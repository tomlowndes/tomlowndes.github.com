I've been looking for a Millenium Falcon schematic poster, but I couldn't find one that I liked. So I decided to design my own. I found a schematic drawing in a Star Wars book that I owned. I scanned it and replicated it using the pen tool.

##Vector Drawing

<img src="http://www.tomlowndes.co.uk/images/work/falcon/falcon.gif">

This is one of the most time consuming vector drawings I have ever done, It took me about 5 hours to get to a stage that I was happy with. The gif above illustrates the process of how I drew it in stage, so that if I made a mistake or wanted to change a section I could easly do so.

##Finishing off
Once I had drawn the top down view I drew the front on schematic which was not as complex then arranged them both on an A2 file. I wanted to make the background look like space, so I chose a dark purple colour and change the vector Falcon to white so i stood out on the dark backround. 

I then added stars and a tiny Death star in the bottom corner. I'm really pround of this poster, it's not 100% accurete but I like it as I designed it.
