Hotline Miami is a indie game that was released in late 2012. I was so in love with this game during its development that I could not wait for it to be released. So I made a poster for its release.

##What I Did
I really wanted to create a gritty, stylized poster in anticipation of the release of this game, I had a look at some early artwork and gameplay screenshots and came up with this idea.

##Concept Idea
The concept was to create a painted, dream like mural of the main character. From the early artwork and screenshots I noticed that the lead character always wore mask, which in the final game is a main mechanic of your success. 

So I wanted to include a masked character in my artwork, I took three images, the manâ€™s body, the mask and the gun and combined them in Photoshop.

Then in Illustrator using the pen tool drew over it adding shadow and highlights till I got the basic figure. 

##Finished Result
To get the finished result of a warn out, halftone, printed poster. I took the image back into Photoshop to finish it all off.
