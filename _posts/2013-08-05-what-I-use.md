##Design Apps


**[Photoshop](www.adobe.com) for editing photos** I've tried other apps for editing photo's but i just feel that photoshop is a compleate packadge that I can work efficiantly within

**[Illustrator](www.adobe.com) for vector work** I use this for all vector based design work as well, it handles type better than photoshop, and its just the best program around for vector work.

**[Indesign](www.adobe.com) for layouts and print based work** Works amazingly when doing any layout based design, I love grids and using them affectivly to get the best from a design.

**[Sublime text 2](www.sublimetext.com/2‎) an excerlant html + css editer** Easyist and best html + css editor, again tried alot of defferent apps over the years but this one always seems to win out in my eyes

**[Tower](www.git-tower.com/‎) the best Github client** Just a good way to acsess github, I use it a fair bit now as my website is hosted on github.

**[Forklift](www.binarynights.com/‎) a powefull ftp client** Good ftp client to acsess my company website as well as servers that I use

**[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/‎) for running windows and linuk on a mac** This is a powerfull enough app for running a windows and linux Virtual machine, the design software I use for cnc work is windows based so It's an essential part of my day to day programs

**[Skype](www.skype.com/‎) messaging and phone calls** Brilliant app for getting in touch with clients as well as other designers working on the same projects.

##Utilities (In order of usage)
Apps that make your life easier.

**[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) for storage/backup** I currently run two dropbox's simultainiosly on my mac, instructions can be found [here](). I use one for my personal documents, a dump file for photo's and a current work folder. My current work folder has about 5 - 10 projects. Once a project gets compleated I back it up to my external drive.

My secound Dropbox account I use for Clients to share files with me and also to share files and folder with them. Basically a dump that is about 2.5gb 

**[Sip](http://theolabrothers.com/sip/) simple color picker** This is used alot using cmd+alt+shift+p brings up the magnifying glass, click the colour you want and it saves it in a format you design, #hex is my main choice.

**[Shush](http://mizage.com/shush/) for muiting your microphone** This is not used alot but when in a skype call can save you from saying somthing you dont want the other person to hear, you simply hold fn when you want to talk or double click fn to keep you microphone on.

**[Bartender](www.macbartender.com/‎) for keeping the menubar clean** I hate having like 15 icons in the top right of the screen, so Bartender hides away app the I might need quick acsess to but dont want to see all the time

**[Alfrid](www.alfredapp.com/‎)** for quick app acsess** so as well as moving my mouse to the top left to get to my app selection screen. Alfred can be used to search for them. by presing alt+spacebar, I can then quicly enter the app I am after.

**[Shiftit](code.google.com/p/shiftit/‎) for controlling windows** Just press cmd+alt+ctrl and a direction and the window will go to that possition on the screen, press cmd+alt+ctrl + / - and the size of the window will grow or shrink. 

**[Jitouch](www.jitouch.com/‎) for better mouse and trackpad** add alot more swipe features to both mouse and trackpad and becomes secound nature to close and refresh pages in next to no time.

**[Hazel](www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php‎) automates folder controll** This is an app that I have only just started to explore but I love it, I have set it up to watch my download folder, photo's go to picture folder, songs to music and films to movie's. Keeping just apps and other file type in my download folder. It also cleans up files that have been sitting in there over two weeks, and moves then to a "to be deleated" folder.
