Today I want to talk about this website for a bit. I’ve been having some thoughts lately, on whether I should focus on: **writing more often** for this blog, or **improving my skills** and actively enhancing my portfolio with design pieces.
<!--more-->

##The Blog
Having a **blog is great**. You get to share your thoughts, your opinions, your experiences and in this case, teach people and solve problems. The most visited pages of this website are those belonging to the blog. But writing often takes up much of my free time. Time that could be spent elsewhere, on improving my craft for example.

I’m guilty of doing this: I go on Google, search for my problem, find a blog that shows the solution — usually within the top three Google results — read the solution and **get the hell out**. No commenting on the post, no subscribing to it, or any of that jazz. Maybe tweet about it. Not to mention bumping into the types of blog posts like the one you’re reading now. My head is screaming: *“I don’t care!”*.

Well this has become **a problem for me**. Although I’m getting near-the-top positions in search results for many keywords, I don’t appreciate it. Google traffic comes, reads my solution and GTFO. My website’s bounce rate reflects this behaviour: it’s at around 73%, which is high. **EDIT: This dropped as of May 2012; it’s at 52%**. There are a number of possible causes for this, one being my writing. Another could be the length of the blog posts. Who has time in 2012 to spend eight minutes reading a blog post?

_“But Alex, you don’t have any kind of signup/subscribe form on your blog”_, I hear you saying. _“That would make readers coming back for more”_. Well, I used to have one.

I used to have not one, but **two forms** on the same page making it impossible to miss. And you know what the result was? Countless **unverified e-mails** and around 300-400 subscribers with a click rate of 14%. Apparently shoving signup forms in people’s faces and making them subscribe doesn’t work in the long term. It’s much like magazine advertisements nowadays. And FYI, advertising should only be used for **reinforcing a brand** — sticking in the person’s memory — not trying to attract new customers with it. Word of mouth is the only form of advertising that continues thriving. And there isn’t any word of mouth for this blog the way it has evolved.

##The Portfolio
The portfolio is the most **important aspect of this website**. I earn a living from showcasing my work. It’s firmly embedded in the ideology of SicanStudios: the portfolio should speak in the name of the design company. The portfolio is the first thing a visitor sees — unless they’re coming from search engines — when visiting this site.

I designed the browsing experience of my portfolio is such way, to favour the **newest website/work**. Not only that, but also to subtly make the visitor accord more time for each piece — more than he would for a thumbnail — and allow me, the designer, to explain the design choices and production.

These days the web changes at a frantic pace. I know my portfolio is dated as soon as I *“take it out of the box”*. And this saddens me, because **my skills are better** than what I show off in the portfolio. And I acknowledge the fact that my skills are getting better with each new project I finish.

##The Mexican Standoff
Having a blog has the potential to **go evergreen** — blog posts written 2 years ago are still being read nowadays — whereas browsing the portfolio doesn’t **help anyone or provide solutions**; it’s merely for exposing work and demonstrating my skills. At most it will make a minimal impact on the visitor who will appreciate my skills and maybe mention me on Twitter. With the blog, I help many people find **solutions to their problems** whereas with a portfolio I help no-one but myself: **showing off new work** in order to get more work.

The potential clients and companies don’t care about a blog; have you ever gotten a client through your blog? I certainly haven’t. All they care about is (I hope not “qualifications” in the design industry!) **your portfolio**. Is it any good? Can you make stuff? Usable, beautiful stuff? Can you collaborate with a team? Are you trustworthy?

> _“No sir, my skillset has stalled because I was writing tutorials and helping people through my blog”_

…is not a valid answer.

So which one is it: **Improve my craft** or **write about solutions** and help people? The **Portfolio** or the **Blog**? *“Both”* I hear you say? Should I remind you that a day only has twenty-four hours? An insightful article on this blog, equipped with a demo, code snippets, links, proper research, etc., takes me around five-six hours to complete.

##Conclusion
I tried to make this blog post short enough for you to finish — I know you don’t finish my blog posts, I check my stats. Anyway, this is what’s been bothering me for the last couple of days. Care to share your opinion? I’d love your input on this subject matter. You can find me 24/7 <a href="http://twitter.com/sican">on Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:alex@sicanstudios.com">write me an email</a>. See you around!
